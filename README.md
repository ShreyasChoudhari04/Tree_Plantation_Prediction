# 🌱 Green AI – AI-Based Urban Heat Mitigation & Tree Plantation System 🌍

This repository contains an **AI-based Urban Heat Mitigation System** developed as part of my **Green AI Internship**.  
The project focuses on identifying **urban heat hotspot regions** and recommending **tree plantation zones** to support sustainable and climate-resilient urban planning.

## 🔍 Project Overview

Rapid urbanization leads to higher temperatures in cities due to dense infrastructure and reduced greenery, a phenomenon known as the **Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect**.

This project applies **machine learning, environmental data analysis, and map-based visualization** to:
- Detect heat-prone urban regions
- Recommend optimal locations for tree plantation
- Support data-driven environmental decision-making

---

## 🧠 Backend (AI & Data Processing)

The backend represents the **core intelligence** of the system.

### Backend Responsibilities:
- Environmental & spatial data preprocessing  
- Feature simulation and extraction  
- Heat hotspot identification using ML logic  
- Zone-wise analysis  
- Tree plantation recommendation  
- Map generation for visualization  

### Backend Workflow:
1. Collect and preprocess environmental data  
2. Generate features (simulated where real data is unavailable)  
3. Apply ML-based logic to detect heat hotspots  
4. Identify 2–3 critical heat-prone zones  
5. Recommend suitable tree plantation areas  
6. Send results for frontend visualization

## 🖥️ Frontend (Visualization)

The frontend provides a **user-friendly and interactive map-based interface** to visualize the backend results.

### Frontend Features:
- Interactive geographic maps  
- Heat hotspot visualization  
- Tree plantation zone display  
- Simple and intuitive UI  
- Designed for non-technical users

## 🌳 Tree Plantation Recommendation

Based on hotspot severity, the system recommends planting **native and shade-providing trees** such as:
- Neem  
- Peepal  
- Mango  

These species help reduce surface temperature and improve urban microclimates.

## ⚠️ Important Note on Data & Randomness

Some parts of this project use **randomized/simulated data** to:
- Demonstrate the AI pipeline
- Simulate environmental variability
- Enable model testing in the absence of complete labeled real-world datasets

✔ Controlled randomness is used  
✔ The system architecture supports **real-world data integration** (AQI, weather APIs)  
✔ This project is intended as a **prototype and learning-focused internship project**
